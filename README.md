# CSE-4.2-Pattern-Recognition-Lab-Project
In this study, we tried to explore the opportunity to detect the surface crack with the help of a deep learning methods. The research approach of this paper can be adopted in various types of damage detections such as the scaling of the concrete surface, piles of bridges, peeling paint of steel and concrete, and so on.
